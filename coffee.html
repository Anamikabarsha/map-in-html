Do you want to known about coffee
   </h1> 
   <p class="drosro">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
        berries <br>from certain Coffea species. All fruit must be further processed
         from a raw<br> material—the fruit and seed—into a stable, raw product; un-roasted,
          green coffee. To process <br>the berries, the seed is separated from the fruit to produce
           green coffee. Green coffee is then<br> roasted, a process which transforms the raw product 
           (green coffee) into a consumable product <br>(roasted coffee).
