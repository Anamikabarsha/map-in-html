   <p class="drosro">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out
        sequences of arithmetic or <br>logical operations automatically.
        Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations<br> known
         as programs.These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of
          tasks.<br> A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the
           hardware, operating system<br> (main software), and peripheral equipment
            needed and used for "full" operation.This term<br> may alsorefer to a
             group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a
              computer<br> network or computer cluster.
