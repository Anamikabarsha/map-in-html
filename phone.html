Do you want to known about phone
   </h1> 
   <p class="drosro">A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct<br>
        a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. A telephone converts sound, <br>typically
         and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted <br>via cables and other
          communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the<br> receiving user. The term 
          is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice),<br> together meaning distant voice.
